# Simulation-of-Reliable-Data-Communication-in-Disaster-Zones
This project simulates reliable data communication in disaster-prone areas where traditional communication infrastructure (like cellular networks) may fail.   The simulation models a small network of mobile nodes (e.g., rescue teams, drones) that exchange data messages with reliability mechanisms .
